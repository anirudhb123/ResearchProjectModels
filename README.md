This repository contains code implementations for various models aimed at detecting anomalies in proton-proton collision data collected from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The detection of anomalies in such data is crucial for identifying rare and potentially interesting events that could signal new physics beyond the Standard Model.

#Introduction
Proton-proton collision data generated by the LHC experiments are rich sources of information about fundamental particles and their interactions. However, amidst the vast amount of data produced, anomalies or rare events that could signify novel phenomena can be easily obscured. Anomaly detection techniques play a vital role in sifting through this data to identify events of interest.

#Models
The repository includes three categories of anomaly detection models:

#Supervised Models:


#Unsupervised Models:

Autoencoders: Deep learning models trained to reconstruct normal data, identifying anomalies as deviations from the reconstructed data.

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): A variant of autoencoders that learn the underlying probability distribution of the data, enabling the detection of outliers based on the reconstruction error and learned distribution.
#Usage
Each model is implemented in a separate Python script within the models directory. You can run these scripts individually to train and evaluate each model on your proton-proton collision data.

#Prerequisites
Python 3.x
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn
TensorFlow
